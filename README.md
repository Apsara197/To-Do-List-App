# To-Do-List-App
A simple and interactive task manager where users can add, mark as complete/incomplete, and delete tasks. Tasks are stored using Local Storage, so they stay saved even after refreshing or reopening the browser. Great beginner-friendly project to understand DOM manipulation and local storage in JavaScript.
